### Workflow for Building the Semi-Automated Colorimetric Sensor

### **Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Component Selection**

#### Components:
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (or Raspberry Pi Zero for a more compact build)
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module** (for image capture)
- **LEDs** (diffuse white LEDs or RGB LEDs for lighting)
- **16x2 LCD Display** or **Small Touchscreen** (for output)
- **Proximity Sensor (IR sensor)** or **Capacitive Touch Sensor** (to detect when a test strip is placed)
- **Battery Pack** (Li-ion battery or 18650 battery setup with charger module)
- **Switch** (for powering on/off the device)
- **Power Regulator (if using batteries)**
- **Glass Plate** (acrylic or tempered glass to hold the test strip)
- **Custom Enclosure** (Acrylic sheets, 3D-printed parts, or off-the-shelf project box)
- **Miscellaneous**: Wires, connectors, jumper cables, breadboard (for testing), screws, standoffs, light diffuser (optional).

#### Tools:
- **3D Printer** (for the enclosure, if you plan to print it)
- **Laser Cutter** (for acrylic parts, if available)
- **Soldering Kit**
- **Screwdriver, Wire Cutters, etc.**

### **Step 2: System Architecture and Design**
- **Plan the Layout**: 
   - The Raspberry Pi and camera will be housed under the glass platform.
   - The camera will be mounted under the glass, aligned with the center of the test strip.
   - LEDs will be arranged around the camera (or on the sides of the glass platform) to illuminate the strip.
   - The LCD will be mounted on the front or side of the enclosure, where it is easy to read.
   - The proximity sensor or touch sensor will detect when a test strip is placed on the glass.
   - Batteries and switch will be placed in a compartment accessible for easy replacement.
  
  **Create a rough design** (either on paper or using CAD software like Fusion 360 or Tinkercad).

### **Step 3: Prototyping the Circuit and Testing Components**
1. **Connect the Camera to Raspberry Pi**:
   - Set up the Raspberry Pi Camera Module by attaching it to the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Install necessary drivers and ensure you can capture images via `raspistill` command.

2. **Proximity Sensor Setup**:
   - Connect the IR sensor to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi. Write a simple Python script to detect when the test strip is placed (the sensor triggers when an object comes close).
   
   Example:
   ```python
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time

   SENSOR_PIN = 17
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(SENSOR_PIN, GPIO.IN)

   while True:
       if GPIO.input(SENSOR_PIN) == GPIO.LOW:
           print("Test strip detected")
           # Trigger LEDs and Camera
       time.sleep(0.1)
   ```

3. **LED Control**:
   - Connect the LEDs to the Raspberry Pi via GPIO pins. You can control the LEDs using a simple Python script to turn them on when the test strip is detected.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   LED_PIN = 18
   GPIO.setup(LED_PIN, GPIO.OUT)
   
   def turn_on_led():
       GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.HIGH)
   
   def turn_off_led():
       GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.LOW)
   ```

4. **Display Setup**:
   - Attach a 16x2 LCD display or a small touchscreen display to the Raspberry Pi. If you use an LCD, connect it via I2C or GPIO and test displaying text (e.g., the pH value).
   
   Example (for I2C LCD):
   ```python
   import I2C_LCD_driver

   lcd = I2C_LCD_driver.lcd()

   lcd.lcd_display_string("pH: 7.0", 1)
   ```

5. **Battery and Power Management**:
   - Set up the battery pack with the Raspberry Pi, ensuring you have a reliable 5V power supply.
   - Add a switch to power the Raspberry Pi on and off.

### **Step 4: Software and Image Processing (Python + OpenCV)**
1. **Install OpenCV**:
   On the Raspberry Pi, install OpenCV for image processing.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
   ```

2. **Capture and Process the Image**:
   Write a script to capture the image using the Raspberry Pi camera and process it using OpenCV to detect the color change.

   Example:
   ```python
   import cv2

   def capture_image():
       camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
       ret, frame = camera.read()
       if ret:
           cv2.imwrite('test_strip.jpg', frame)
       camera.release()

   def analyze_image():
       image = cv2.imread('test_strip.jpg')
       hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
       # Analyze the color here and compare with predefined values
       # Convert HSV value to a chemical concentration, e.g., pH level

   capture_image()
   analyze_image()
   ```

3. **Color Calibration**:
   - Capture test strip images with known pH levels.
   - Use OpenCV to extract the HSV values of the relevant portion of the test strip.
   - Create a reference table mapping the HSV values to pH levels for comparison.

### **Step 5: Enclosure Design and Assembly**
1. **Design the Enclosure**:
   - Use CAD software (like Fusion 360 or Tinkercad) to design the enclosure based on the dimensions of your components (glass, camera, LEDs, display, etc.).
   - Make sure to include cutouts for the glass platform, camera, LED mounts, and display.
   - Add a compartment for the battery and a small cutout for the power switch.

2. **Fabricate the Enclosure**:
   - **3D Printing**: If you have a 3D printer, print the enclosure parts and assemble them.
   - **Laser Cutting**: For an acrylic design, use a laser cutter to create the glass platform and other parts.

3. **Assemble the Components**:
   - Fix the camera module under the glass platform.
   - Place the LEDs around the camera or glass edges.
   - Mount the display behind or near the glass for easy visibility.
   - Place the Raspberry Pi in the lower compartment with proper cable management.

4. **Test the Enclosure Fit**:
   - Ensure that all components fit neatly within the enclosure.
   - Check that the test strip is correctly aligned with the camera and that the LEDs provide uniform lighting.

### **Step 6: Final Testing and Calibration**
1. **Test Strip Detection**: Ensure the sensor reliably detects when a test strip is placed on the glass and that the camera and LEDs activate automatically.
2. **Image Capture and Analysis**: Test the system with actual test strips and validate that the image processing accurately detects the color and provides the correct pH value.
3. **Adjust Calibration**: Fine-tune the color detection by adjusting the reference values in your code for more precise pH readings.
4. **Battery Life**: Test the device on battery power to ensure it operates efficiently and that power management is working (e.g., LEDs and camera turn off when not needed).
5. **User Interface**: Verify that the LCD or touchscreen display is readable and that the pH result is clearly shown to the user.

### **Step 7: Deployment and User Testing**
1. **Deploy the Device**: Once fully assembled, test the device in real-world conditions (e.g., different lighting environments, different test strips) to ensure reliability.
2. **Get User Feedback**: Ask others to use the device and gather feedback on usability. Make any necessary adjustments based on this feedback.
3. **Documentation**: Document the entire process, including component details, design files, and code, for future reference or to share with others.
